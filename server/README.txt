-- Then launch mysql with shell command "mysql.server start"

-- If you don't have database "race01_db" on your machine, then run "sql/create_db.sql" script with mysql
   (shell script: mysql -u <username> -p<password> source sql/create_db.sql)

-- Finally open "server" directory and run shell script "npm start" and don't close console
